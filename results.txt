n the first program, every number was different for every value of "i". 
In the second program, at first the numbers were random too. 
As "i" increased though, the outputs became the same number.
I liked changing the "magic numbers" to varaibles also. It makes it easier to 
see what the numbers are and it makes it alot easier to change the numbers
by having their assignment in a varaible.
